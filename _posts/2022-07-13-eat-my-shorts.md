There is no good social platform for me where I can post some shorter forms. I mean, there is a whole valley between a tweet and full-fledged technical posts. Sometimes I want to just write some short commentary or self-document a nice discovery or perhaps share some interesting bit of code. For that twitter feels terribly inadequate and I hate long threads with passion - the form, not the content of course. On the other hand I always tried to keep things like that away from my blog.
 
If something doesn't exist you have to sometimes create it yourself. From now on there will be two types of content - long and technical articles as well as *Shorts*. I've updated the layout and introduced tags to keep them visually separate. I'm not sure if that works but I hope you will find it enjoyable.
